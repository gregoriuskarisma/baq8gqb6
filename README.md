# Applied Mathematics Project - Single Variable Calculus
这套 MATLAB 脚本演示了如何运用计算方法探索应用数学中的概念。本研究通过模拟连续逻辑斯蒂增长模型和离散逻辑斯蒂映射来探究动态系统，包括生成分岔图以可视化从稳定平衡态到混沌行为的转变。该项目还深入探讨了数值分析，运用牛顿法求根，并通过数值验证其二次收敛速度。然后，应用一种受微积分启发的技术，使用有限差分作为离散导数来检测和纠正多项式编码方案中的错误，突出了数学理论在信息处理中的实际应用。

This collection of MATLAB scripts demonstrates the application of computational methods to explore concepts in applied mathematics. The investigation covers dynamical systems by simulating the continuous logistic growth model and the discrete logistic map, including the generation of a bifurcation diagram to visualize the transition from stable equilibria to chaotic behavior. The project also delves into numerical analysis by implementing Newton's method to find roots and numerically verifying its quadratic rate of convergence. Then, a calculus-inspired technique is applied, using finite differences as a discrete derivative to detect and correct errors in a polynomial-based coding scheme, highlighting the practical use of mathematical theory in information processing.
